The HCRC Map Task Corpus is a set of 128 dialogues that has been recorded, transcribed, and
annotated for a wide range of behaviours, and has been released for research purposes.

## Task Description

The Map Task is a cooperative task involving two participants. The two speakers sit
opposite one another and each has a map which the other cannot see. One speaker --
designated the Instruction Giver -- has a route marked on her map; the other speaker --
the Instruction Follower -- has no route. The speakers are told that their goal is to
reproduce the Instruction Giver's route on the Instruction Follower's map. The maps are
not identical and the speakers are told this explicitly at the beginning of their first
session. It is, however, up to them to discover how the two maps differ.



## Familiarity and Eye-Contact

In addition to the design variables relating to the maps themselves, two other variables
were incorporated in the design of the corpus overall.  Subjects are necessarily paired
for the task, and since the pairing is under the experimenter's control we were able to
vary systematically the familiarity between the participants, by asking subjects to attend
with a friend. Each pair of familiar subjects was tested in coordination with another pair
who were unknown to either member of the first pair. Two pairs formed a quadruple of
subjects who used among them a different set of four map-pairs, with maps being assigned
to pairs by Latin Square. Each subject participated in four dialogues, twice as
Instruction Giver and twice as Instruction Follower, once in each case with a familiar
partner, and once with an unfamiliar partner. As Instruction Giver they gave directions on
the same map, but when following they used different maps each time. Half of the subjects
gave instructions to a familiar partner first, the others to an unfamiliar partner first.

The option of placing a small barrier between Map Task participants to prevent them from
seeing each other's faces allowed us to control the availability of the visual channel for
communication. Half of the subjects who took part in the task were able to make
eye-contact with their partner, while the other half had no eye-contact.

## Procedure

Subjects sat three or four feet apart, facing each other across a desk, with their maps
placed on sloping boards, to prevent each subject seeing the other's map. Pairs of
subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two "eye-contact" conditions.  After they
had completed their map dialogues, subjects were asked to read a wordlist containing all
the feature names from the set of maps they had encountered. Feature names appeared twice
in random order, and subjects were asked to read the list slowly and carefully, aiming for
a between word interval of approximately one second. These list readings provided citation
forms against which the unscripted dialogue forms could be compared.

Materials were recorded on Digital Audio Tape (Sony DTC1000ES) using one Shure SM10A
close-talking microphone and one DAT channel per speaker. Split-screen video recordings
were also made for half of the dialogues, capturing an almost full-face image of both
subjects. Dialogues were orthographically transcribed and then checked several times
against the original DAT recordings.

### Participants
All sixty-four subjects who participated were undergraduates at the University of Glasgow.
Sixty-one of the 64 subjects were Scottish, 56 of them having been born or brought-up
within a thirty mile radius of Glasgow. Half the subjects were male, half were female, and
their mean age was 20. Subjects accommodated easily to the task and experimental setting,
producing unselfconscious and relatively fluent speech.





## Experimental Design

The experiment uses a Latin Squares design. Participants were asked to come to the
experiment with someone they knew, thus forming familiar pairs. Two pairs make a quad. In
the table, a1 came with a2, and b1, with b2.
